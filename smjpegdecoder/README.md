# smjpegdecoder

A pure Java [SMJPEG](http://wiki.multimedia.cx/index.php?title=SMJPEG) decoder.

SMJPEG is video [format](http://www.lokigames.com/development/download/smjpeg/SMJPEG.txt) used by [Loki games](http://www.lokigames.com/development/smjpeg.php3).

Frames are individually compressed as jpeg images. Jpeg decompression is done with Matthias Mann's [jpegdecoder](http://hg.l33tlabs.org/JpegDecoder/).
